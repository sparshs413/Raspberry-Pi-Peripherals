# Raspberry Pi Touch Display
##Introduction
The Raspberry Pi Touch Display is an LCD display which connects to the Raspberry Pi through the DSI connector. In some situations, it allows for the use of both the HDMI and LCD displays at the same time (this requires software support).

##Board support
The DSI display is designed to work with all models of Raspberry Pi, however early models that do not have mounting holes (the Raspberry Pi 1 model A and B) will require additional mounting hardware to fit the HAT-dimensioned stand-offs on the display PCB.

##Physical Installation
The following image shows how to attach the Raspberry Pi to the back of the Touch Display (if required), and how to connect both the data (ribbon cable) and power (red/black wires) from the Raspberry Pi to the display. If you are not attaching the Raspberry Pi to the back of the display, take extra care when attaching the ribbon cable to ensure it is the correct way round. The black and red power wires should be attached to the GND and 5v pins respectively.
